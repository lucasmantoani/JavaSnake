# JavaS'nake
Simple Snake-like game using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

* HTML5 was used to make the basic HTML page and create the Canevas used for the game.
* CSS 3 was used for the style of the page, the resert button and the link to this Repository.
* Javascript was used for the rest.. only 95% of the job.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
* The idea came from an article on FreeCodeCamp called "Snake Game Python Tutorial" (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-game-python-tutorial/)
